Testing of the pi driving server will be automated via a "test mode." This will involve adding a third end point to post to the Flask server, which will be launched by the main driver on the other end of the video stream, which will send a known timeseries of instructions. The timeseries of instructions will be saved to disk by the Pi for comparison to the known timeseries sent.

Fail safetiness of the server will be tested by hooking up the pi to an external monitor, killing the server, and checking that the car stops.

Automatic login and starting of the pi server scripts are simple to test by starting the pi and checking if it automatically logs in, connects to the local wifi network, and starts the server.
